# Air Quality Predicator Using Real-Time Sensor Data

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict air quality using real-time sensor data. It utilizes environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and weight, and classifies the air quality into categories like **Good**, **Moderate**, or **Poor** using multiple machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Ingests live sensor data for air quality prediction.
- **Multiple ML Algorithms:** Utilizes various machine learning models for classification.
- **Categorical Output:** Predicts air quality levels (Good, Moderate, Poor).
- **Easy Integration:** Designed for extensibility with additional sensors or features.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn or similar libraries (assumed)
- **License:** MIT License

## Usage

1. Connect your environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.)
2. Run the prediction script to classify air quality in real time.
3. Output will indicate the current air quality category.

## Project Structure

- Sensor data ingestion and preprocessing
- Machine learning model training and prediction
- Output classification for air quality levels
